The goal of this project is state management.
The objectives:
- use html to render text in the app. 
- use bootstrap to style the text and make buttons.
- text and design mobile so that it could fit any size. It is easier to go bigger than go smaller. 
- create a button that is labled "GO" that takes the app to the "beginning state."
- create a button that returns the app to its pre- beggining state. 
- create multiple next buttons that send the app into the next states in chronological order. 
- a reveal button that links to the last state.
