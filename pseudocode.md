# The goal of this project is state management.
## The objectives:
- use html to render text in the app. 
- use bootstrap to style the text and make buttons.
- text and design mobile so that it could fit any size. It is easier to go bigger than go smaller. 
- create a button that is labled "GO" that takes the app to the "beginning state."
- create a button that returns the app to its pre- beggining state. 
- create multiple next buttons that send the app into the next states in chronological order. 
- a reveal button that links to the last state. 

## The buttons I need: goBtn, nextBtn, resetBtn, revealBtn.
- goBtn: starts 
- nextBtn: next page
- resetBtn: back to main page.
- revealBtn: shows up if page 5 is visible and is the link between page 5 and page 6. 

## Home Page
- need a go button that displays the next page but also hides the home page. 
- needs to display a specific text
- when I press go, I will remove home page text and replace it with page 1 text; I will need to reveal 2 other buttons on the next page; add more little text under the next button.
