Create a page that plays a mind game with a user. 

## First display text on the screen that will display as the instructions. This and a "GO" button will have to diplay in the first state.
### create a function that refers to the HTML and replaces the text with instructions.
- create a variable that references the html.
- perform an innerText function that replaces the text with a string.

`Init

START
variable.referencehtml = 'string that I would like to replace html with'
END`
This code can also work with the button.

## Next create 3 buttons.
- Go button will start the app. It is simple as changing page 0 to page 1. 
`Init

Start
function NextPage (){
    incremental method
    state function.
}
variable.eventListener('nextPage function')
END`
